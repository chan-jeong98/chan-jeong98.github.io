## Project: Game Time

## Overview
The problem: College students get exhausted from extensive studying and need time to recuperate. However, most communication platforms used in universities are for 
educational purposes and are not appropriate for finding people you want to chill/hang out with. Additionally, you are just not ready to deal with that hangover when you have
an early 8 am class the next day. Tinder/Bumble can be misleading and is a bit too much of an overkill to find hangout buddies.

The solution: Game Time is an application for university students (UHM specifically) that let students find other people to play games with that share the same interests and hobbies.

## Approach
To use Game Time, users will need a registered account. They will need to update their profile page to best help them find the people they want to connect with.
The profile page should contain information that is relevant, such as what genre of games you usually play, specific games that you play, and a discord ID (if applicable).
Details can be further discussed in the integrated messeging function. 

There will also be an opportunity to join communities, so you are not limited to interacting with only one person at a time. You will be given the opportunity to interact with
many different people that share the same interests as you. 

Users will be able to see which people are not pleasant to play with through the usage of ratings. Ratings would be based on an honor system, and should not be abused to active grief somebody
else's chance at grasping a social life online.

## Mock up page ideas

Some mock up pages might include:

-Landing page
-User Profile page
-Community page
-Search interests page
-Other peoples' profile page

## Use case ideas

-User goes to the home page, creates an account, logs in, and completes their user profile with as much information as possible
-User searches up other users and contacts them if interested in playing a game or two together
-Other users can find the user and do the exact same thing
-Communities can be created where users can join and see a lot more other people who might be interested in the same thing they are.

## Beyond the basics

-Allow users to give other users a rating (satisfactory to play with, undesirable, etc).
-Decrease the chance of showing up in searches/limit ability to join communities if bad rating
-DM interface so users do not have to resort to external resources to communicate
-Ability to organize and plan game sessions
